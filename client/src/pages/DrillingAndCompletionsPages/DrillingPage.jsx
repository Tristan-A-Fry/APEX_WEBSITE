              Our drilling services include developing Field Development Plans including: full costs, and timelines associated with each step of the execution, developing and executing detailed FEED plans, selecting all equipment required to drill and complete wells, developing detailed drilling and completions procedures with clear and concise instructions for operations, and tendering new service contracts for drilling and completion services based on technical and commercial evaluations.

              We focus on vendor periodic performance reviews to discuss equipment reliability issues, including spare part availability. Frequency: minimum monthly or more frequently if needed, working directly with the BOP component manufacturer (OEM supplier) instead of BOP OEMs for SPM valves and other control components.

              This approach enables better QA/QC of components, reviewing Root Cause Failure Analysis to identify and eliminate the causes of component failure, planning processes for between well maintenance activities, and ensuring adequate staffing for 24-hour operation.

              Well integrity is ensured throughout the operational period, with known and anticipated operational limits to ensure safe drilling in time and budget. We verify system compliance, define operating limits for each condition, and determine system responses under defined variations to provide loads for equipment design and capacity.

              This includes operability envelopes, ship response times, load histograms for fatigue life estimates, and more. We also support the execution of safety strategy, including fatigue testing as needed.
